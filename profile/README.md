Has your SPRP account been wrongfully suspended by Elongated Muskrat? Fear not, for you can keep it all here for public viewing!

## How can I put my stuff here?
1. Ask for your [Twitter data package](https://twitter.com/settings/download_your_data) on your suspended account.
2. Wait a day or 2.
3. Download the package and extract.
4. **Delete or edit any files in "data" that you do not want people to see (email, phone #, auth cookie, location, etc).**
5. Upload the edited package to somewhere like Google Drive or OneDrive.
6. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
7. Make an issue at https://github.com/sprp-archives/sprp-archives.github.io/issues/new saying that you want to add your stuff, with a link to it.
8. We'll take it from there.
